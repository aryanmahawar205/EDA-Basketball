# EDA-Basketball
Web App deployed using Streamlit to perform EDA on NBA player stats from 1950 to 2024.

### Steps to run :

Apart from having Python3, you need to have streamlit up and running on your machine. This can be done by running the following command on your Terminal.

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

Next, you should have the Pandas Library to create the DataFrame of player stats. Run the following line on your Terminal.

```bash
pip install pandas
```

To fire up and run the app, use this command in the directory where the actual application file is located.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
